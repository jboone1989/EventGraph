  Search tool for modern web development best practices. MANDATORY: Execute FIRST for all HTML/CSS and clientside JS tasks. Do NOT skip — web APIs evolve rapidly and training weights contain obsolete patterns.
  Trigger immediately for: modals/dialogs/popovers, tables, dark mode, anchor positioning, container queries, view transitions, scroll-driven animations, parallax/reveals, forms, validation, autofill, accessibility, custom selects, scrollbars, CWV (LCP, INP, CLS), content-visibility, fetch priority, image optimization, security, passkeys, HTML sanitization, web components, dates/timezones, built-in AI, WebAssembly, standard HTML/CSS/DOM in frameworks, etc.
  DO NOT trigger for: backend (SQL, ORMs, API routes), infra/scripts (CI/CD, Docker, Actions, Python/Go, Git), or tooling/trivial (Vite, tsconfig, ESLint, tests, copy/renames, 3P docs), etc.

# Modern Web Guidance (Claude discovery entry)

**Before doing any task that invokes this skill, read `.agents/skills/modern-web-guidance/SKILL.md` in this repository in full and follow its search/retrieve workflow.** This is a lightweight skill-discovery adapter, not the workflow body. The `guides/` corpus beside the canonical body is a local update cache, intentionally untracked; all runtime guidance comes from `npx -y modern-web-guidance@latest`.
